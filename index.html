			Georgios Grekas is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Applied PDE group of the Applied Mathematics and Computational 
			  Science program (AMCS) of CEMSE division at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, Saudi Arabia. 
			  He received his Ph.D degree from the department of Applied Mathematics from the University of Crete in 2019.
			   He held a postdoctoral associate position at the department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, in University of Minnesota (2019-2022). 
			   Then he moved as a postdoctoral researcher at the Institute of Applied and Computational Mathematics in FORTH, Greece. 
			   He joined KAUST and the Applied PDE group in March 2024. His research interests include solid mechanics, biomechanics,
				numerical analysis and scientific computing.

					Collagen fibers is the main component of cells microenvironment. Throught matrix deformations cells can sense alternations in their microenvironment 
			driving their functions explixitly, like cells movement, deformation, etc and implicitly as nutrient prohibition in high densified regions of collagen 
			fibers, see tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS). Therefore, proposing constitutive laws with minimal assumptions 
			to model these deformations is crusial to elucidate the complex interactions between cells. We suggest a method to construct elastic energy functions starting 
			from 1-dimensional constitutive laws for large deformations. Deriving 2-dimensional elastic energy functions we compare the numerical computed solutions with
			experiment results. In our experimental data robotic cells have been employed, which constract and expand by demand. Our model is capable of capturing numerous 
			experimental observatios, as densified collagen tracts between cells and in the radial direction of each cell, remaining densified regions after unloading and 
			long range mechanosensing as a result of the special proposed nonlinearity. It is noteworthy that this study has been recommended in Faculty 
			Opinions as being of special significance in its field (https://connect.h1.co/article/739575317).

					When an elatic body is subjected to large deformations a multiwell strain energy function is often involved to model the 
					mechanical behaviour of the material appropriately. Essentially this means that the strain energy function is not rank-one 
					convex and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are not elliptic. This adds computational and numerical analysis challenges, for the
					former  suitable minimization techniques are required, while for the latter tools from the calculus of variations with new proposed schemes are 
					needed. Here various numerical schemes are proposed from general convex, to multiwell strain energy functions (first online version for the later finding
					in December of 2024.)
