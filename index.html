					Collagen fibers is the main component of cells microenvironment. Throught matrix deformations cells can sense alternations in their microenvironment 
			driving their functions explixitly, like cells movement, deformation, etc and implicitly as nutrient prohibition in high densified regions of collagen 
			fibers, see tumor associated collagen signatures (TACS). Therefore, proposing constitutive laws with minimal assumptions 
			to model these deformations is crusial to elucidate the complex interactions between cells. We suggest a method to construct elastic energy functions starting 
			from 1-dimensional constitutive laws for large deformations. Deriving 2-dimensional elastic energy functions we compare the numerical computed solutions with
			experiment results. In our experimental data robotic cells have been employed, which constract and expand by demand. Our model is capable of capturing numerous 
			experimental observatios, as densified collagen tracts between cells and in the radial direction of each cell, remaining densified regions after unloading and 
			long range mechanosensing as a result of the special proposed nonlinearity. It is noteworthy that part of this study has been recommended in Faculty 
			Opinions as being of special significance in its field (https://connect.h1.co/article/739575317). We explore further materials of this kind by developing 
			theoretical and computational tools.

					When an elatic body is subjected to large deformations a multiwell strain energy function is often involved to model the 
					mechanical behaviour of the material appropriately. Essentially this means that the strain energy function is not rank-one 
					convex and the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are not elliptic. This adds computational and numerical analysis challenges, for the
					former  suitable minimization techniques are required, while for the latter tools from the calculus of variations with new proposed schemes are 
					needed. Here various numerical schemes are proposed from general convex, to multiwell strain energy functions (first online version for the later finding
					in December of 2024). The suggested numerical schemes have the property that the discrete minimizer of the continuous problem converge to a minimizer
					of the continuous problem as the discretization parameter goes to zero, i.e
					<p>\(\int_\Omega W(\nabla y_h) \rightarrow \int_\Omega W(\nabla y), \text{ as } h\rightarrow 0\)</p><br>
					where \( y_h \) minimizes the discrete problem and \( y \) minimizes the continuous total potential energy.
					To accomplish the above result the theory of \(\Gamma- \)convergence is used. Furthemore, for specific elastic energies
					a generalization of the embedding theorem for Orlicz spaces, to the piecewise polynomial spaces admitting discontinuities were 
					required.
       		  
					<p> In the geometrically nonlinear theory of elasticity it is well known that under specific boundary conditions 
						minimizing sequences arise, forming finer and finer microstructures in order to satisfy continuous deformations with 
						discontinuous deformation gradients, where the deformation gardients belong to the energy wells. 
						To understand better the behaviour of the discrete minization process we construct a two well (modulo rotations)
						 elastic energy. Mimicking the austenite-martensite transitions, more precisely 
						 cubic to orthorhombic transformation, we choose the lattice parameters such that perfect interfaces are formed for the normals n=(1,0),
						  n=(0,1), in the sense that continuous deformations with discontinuous deformation gradients at the energy 
						  wells are allowed along these normals.</p>

						  <p>
						Figure on the right: Discrete minimizers where red, blue colors indicate the attained phases orthorhombic, 
						cubic respectively. The elastic energy is zero everywhere except the transition layers (green colors).
						Finer microstructures emerge for finer mesh resolution. Essentially the discrete minimizers capture elements of
						a sequence \(\{ y_k\} \in W^{1,\infty}(\Omega)\) such that 
						 such that \( y_k\stackrel{\ast}{\rightharpoonup} y_0\) in \(W^{1, \infty}(\Omega) \)
						where \(\{ \nabla y_k\} \)  generates the unique homogeneous Young measure 
						\(\nu_x = 0.5 \delta_I + 0.5 \delta_V\). We show that \(y_0\) is the minimiser of the relaxed problem.

				<div class="text2">
					Unlike standard neural network approaches for PDEs, which typically rely on collocation-type training (whether random or deterministic),
					our approach minimises over neural network spaces using specially designed loss functions that incorporate a finite element-based approximation
					 of the continuous loss. This significantly reduces the number of back-propagation calls within the algorithm, resulting in stable and
					  robust methods for approximating partial differential equations. Additionally, these methods can be integrated with well-established
					   techniques in the finite element community, such as adaptivity and mesh generation, to create hybrid algorithms that combine the
						strengths of both neural networks and finite element methods. In this approach the trained neural network achieve higher accuracy 
						lowering the computational cost significantly. The method has developed for domains in \( \mathbf{R}^n, n=1, 2, 3\). These promising 
						results could indicate improved training techniques in higher dimensional problems as well.

							 magnitude  for the proposed method, while the speed-up was in the range of 4-5 faster than the conventional training procedure for the given

					<p>Potassium sodium niobate is considered a prominent material system as a substitute for lead-containing
						ferroelectric materials. Potential applications range from energy conversion to innovative cooling technologies,
						 thereby addressing important societal challenges. 
						Recently Pop-Ghe et al. [2021 Ceramics International 47.14] synthesized Potassium Sodium Niobate (KNN) samples incorporating 
					an excess of alkali metals during fabrication, suppressing inhomogeneous grain size distribution resulting in a significant
					 fatigue behavior enhancement.  For the fatigue optimized material she and her colleagues observed an unexplained phenomenon 
					 during the orthorhombic to tetragonal transition that they termed intermediate twinning. 
					</p>
					
					 <p>
					 To undersand the appearance of intermediate twinning in this complex phase transformation
					 we design a geometrically nonlinear electroelastic energy depending on the deformation gradient, spontaneous
					   polarization and temperature. Evaluating explicitly the structure of the energy wells from X-ray diffraction measurements, 
					     we predict the observed transformations, intermediate twinning and detailed polarization as minimizers of the proposed free energy.
						</p> 

					<p>We show that phase transformations and spontaneous polarization in KNN are driven through compatibility conditions that ensure continuous
					deformations with discontinuous deformation gradients and pole-free interfaces, presenting a remarkable agreement between theory and 
					experiment. The predictions are transferrable: the theory of geometrically nonlinear electrostriction given in our 
					study provides a route to improve the reversibility of complex ferroelectric ceramics.</p>
					
					<p>
					This study reveals that even if deformations are very small the response of the material is highly nonlinear. The model predicts the cubic to
					tetragonal transformation as a twinned laminate between the tetragonal variants (blue-green clolors) which is compatible to the cubic phase
					 (red color) in top left figure. Furthemore, the theoretical computed interfaces (top right image) forming a crossing twin are compared with
					 the experimental observed orthorhombic phase (bottom left). It is remarkable that superimposing the two images (top right with bottom left)  
					 the theoretical interfaces coincide with the experimental observation.

					<!-- A fully nonlinear electrostrictive model derived from the
			related geometrically nonlinear theory of magnetostriction [James-Kinderl....] is emploed. The main difference being the
			 possible presence of free charges in the ferroelectric case. In this theory the elastic response borrows concepts from
			geometrically nonlinear elasticity [Ball-James ...] and the electrical part borrows ideas from the theory of
			micromagnetics developed by Brown.  -->
